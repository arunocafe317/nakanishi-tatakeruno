# Gameplay
(Click [here](https://youtu.be/GyW3mMV63_0) for a video of the gameplay.)

Notes, or lizards in this case, will appear and start falling down from the top of the gameplay area. The player has to tap on the buttons on the bottom area when these lizards line up with them. Points are scored based on how precisely timed (on beat) the button tap is.

The Arunos at the bottom are the 'lives'. Losing all is game over obviously, but a life is only lost when a note is missed. Preempting doesn't cost a life, although no points will be scored this way. The game will judge whether it is preemptive/premature or an honest attempt to play the note on time. Again, only the latter will trigger the scoring system. A lost life can be regained if the player goes on a streak of successful hits.

When a song is cleared, the performance is rated on a scale of 1 to 3 'gold lizards'.

### Difference with NogiFes
In NogiFes, you play WITH the rhythm of the song. In this game, you play THE rhythm. Those who are familiar with rhythm games in general will notice that they usually fall under these two categories.

### In-game songs

# 'Free Drumming'
This mode becomes available halfway through, and is pretty much your typical 'finger drum' interface with an option to play the backing tracks of songs that have been cleared. Great to jam with if you can for instance hook up your output to an external device/speaker.

# Disclaimer
This game is fan-made and 100% free. We don't own any idol-related assets, audio or visual.

The in-game drum parts are merely loose interpretations of the actual drum parts on the records, arranged in such a way that they are 'playable'. They were never meant to be exact representations.
